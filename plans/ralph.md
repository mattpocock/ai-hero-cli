claude --permission-mode acceptEdits "@plans/prd.json @claude-progress.txt Find the highest-priority feature to work on and work only on that feature. This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority - not necessarily the first in the list. Make a git commit of that feature once you're done and update the PRD. Before committing, check that the types check via pnpm typecheck and that the tests pass via pnpm test. Also update a claude-progress.txt file with the work that was done. ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE. If, while implementing the feature, you notice the PRD is complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>."
